# Traffic-Flow

Coworking Agents is a multi-agent system simulation where autonomous agents interact within a shared environment. The project focuses on coordination, decision-making, and communication between agents operating in the same workspace, with the goal of optimizing traffic flow. The system demonstrates how multiple agents can cooperate, share information, and manage tasks within a distributed setup.
